AI-housing prices in California. 

A group school-project to practice Machine Learning with the Kaggle dataset "California Housing Prices".

The goal was to see what model could perform the best out of all the ones we tested. XGBoost was the one with the best Relative RMSE and was only wrong with a margin of 21%.
